Bonsai History: 
Bonsai is an art form with a rich history.  Beginning in China, the cultivation of Bonsai spread to Japan, where it has been refined.  Over the past century, interest in this fascinating art form has spread to countries throughout the world where bonsai techniques are applied to native plants.

The creation of a bonsai is an application of techniques under artistic design with the intent to create the illusion of a large tree on a miniature scale.  While some plants lend themselves to this practice based on growth habit, leaf size or other features, most any woody plant, tree or shrub can be grown successfully as a bonsai.
