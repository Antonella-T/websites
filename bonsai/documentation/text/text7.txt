Maintenance: 
Creating the bonsai is a first and important part of the bonsai art; caring for your bonsai is a second and no less important part. Indoor plant specimens will require different care than outdoor specimens. With the right care and maintenance, your bonsai will bring you hears of happiness and tranquility. Here are some tips to insure your bonsai has a long and tranquil life:


Repotting

The purpose of repotting is to maintain the vigor of the tree.  As soil is watered and roots grow, the soil will become compacted and drainage will be impaired.  Also, the root system will continue to grow and expand within the limits of the container.  Repotting allows us to trim the roots and encourage the growth of feeder roots, making for a healthier root system and tree.  Repotting is considered an activity requiring intermediate skill.  It can be learned  or self-taught from a book or article, but firsthand experience is hard to beat.
