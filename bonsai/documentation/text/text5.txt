Selecting a Style: 
There are five basic styles of bonsai: formal upright, informal upright, slanting, cascade, and semi-cascade. The style you choose for your tree will depend largely on the natural characteristics of the tree. In the practice of bonsai it believed that the tree should dictate the style, not the artist. A detailed explanation of each style can be view in the Styles of Bonsai section.
